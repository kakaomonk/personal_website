Welcome to my website, I am Henry Park!

Currently, I am studying studying Mathmatics, Computer Science, and Statistics at University of Toronto.

Here are my [resume](Henry (Hyungsoo) Park Resume.pdf) and [CV](Hyungsoo Park Cover Letter General.pdf).

# More about me...
I'm about to graduate my first undergraduate study from University of Toronto, and currenrly working on several projects relate to CS/Analysis fields. Outside of my academic work I have a huge interest in investment (Stocks, Cryptocurrency). This interest also inspired me to work on the "Crpytocurrency Auto-Trader" on my [resume](Henry (Hyungsoo) Park Resume.pdf).

# My goal
I decided to study IT related field(s) because of my personal interests, but I've also found my interest in developing projects. I am a person who like to interact with others and resolve several problems in many factors.
